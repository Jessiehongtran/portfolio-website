                                    In my LEAP (Leading Entrepreneurial Action Project), we had to build a prototype about to launch starting from defining a pain point that it helps to solve. My team members were gathered under the interest in the idea of using drone to make delivery faster. The pitch was presented excitingly by Akriti - a member we chose to work with. Seeing it as an opportunity, however, we did not know where to start and which industry we are in other than the fact that working with drone is so cool. That was a down time in my team since we all felt lost. In every meeting, there were only questions unanswered and the tension that where do we go? That made us even doubt ourselves why we chose this project and why starting it from the beginning. 
                                    Once each member tried to pick an area to focus, we got conflict in our different directions. Eventually with the involvement of our falcuty, we calmed down and got to narrow down into food and pharmaceutial industries where delivery is happening the most. But again, we better pick one, what is that? We chose to start researching pharmaceutical and presented our first pinup:
                                    <img src= "https://res.cloudinary.com/dfulxq7so/image/upload/v1569530303/Pinup1.png" alt="Pinup1" />
                                    </br>Surprisingly, we got very negative feedbacks that the problem is not yet defined, that the concept was too broad, that we were too much in love with drone and that the presentation is poor. That was a very low and not-exciting-as-expected start for our team. Having said that, we got together and considered the feedbacks as room for improvement, we tried to dig deeper to reconsider pharmaceutical and explore food industry. After that, it became clearer that there are more order for food delivery so there is a bigger market here, more importantly, there is a more sense of urgency: "I want to get my food as soon as possible". Despite the fact that other teams already proceeded to interview potential target, the process of defining the pain point thorouly brought us more down to earth, to be more realistic without being stuck around with drone, we affirmed that drone can be one of the solutions but not the only one and does not have to be our destination.

									<h3 class= "text title">The pain point</h3>
									<p><b>Many people find delivered foods come not hot</b> and my team want to solve this problem. So, how might we make food hot during delivery?<br/>By conducting researches our team realized the pain point that while many customers expect to get good food after waiting for delivery, the food sometimes come with low quality (just lukewarm or even cold). Then digging deeper into delivery process involving delivery platform, restaurants and drivers, we understood that the reasons that lead to this low-quality problem is long delivery time due to traffic or waiting time. And since traffic or waiting time are unexpected, we have been trying to control another factor which is delivery package to keep food hot while being delivered. </p>

											<ul>
												<li><p><b>Choose an aspect for prototype development</b><br/>While there are many ways to develop a package that keeps food hot, I want to develop something simple and convenient for use. Also, by seeing that different restaurants may use different type of package, I have thought about <em>a disposable pack</em> that can be put in any packages rather than a specific package for heat function. The pack may look like a disposable preservative pack usually put in instant food. At the same time, having used hand warmer product before, I got inspired to develop something like this but for food. </p></li>
