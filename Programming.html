									<h1>Sharee App</h1>
									<p>Have you ever wanted to share food, book, clothes, opportunities, etc

										to someone else but do not know who is in need of those?
										
										Have you ever had extra resources but do not know where to locate them?
										
										Or have you ever wish someone have that resource for you
										
										to borrow or use for a certain time instead of buying yourself?
										
										If answers to these questions are YES, welcome to Sharee.
										
										And guess what, you do not really need to know someone to be able to share.
										
										Sharee is created to relocate resources in society</p>
									
									<p>I myself initiated the app, designed user journey, Back End and Front End for this app. There are marketing pages and more functions needed to be built.</p>

									<h1>Finding Planet App</h1>
									<p>The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is a space telescope for NASA's Explorers program, designed to search for exoplanets using the transit method in an area 400 times larger than that covered by the Kepler mission.</p>
									<p>In a team including UI, Front End, Back End, Data Science, Machine Learning, we created this app so that users can through light curves vote likability whether a star is a planet and from there, it invokes a community helping to give input about planet exploration.</p>

									<h1>Redux<br />
									Car Sales Project</h1>

								<p>With 
									<a href="https://car-sales.htran2.now.sh/">Car Sales</a>:</br>
									<!-- <ul> -->
										<li>User should be able to add features to their car</li>
										<li>User should be able to remove added features from their car</li>
										<li>Total should update as user adds and removes features from their car</li>

								<div class="image main"><img src="images/car-sales.png" alt="" /></div>

								<p>To create these above features, I did:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>create a Redux Store and connect it to a React application</li>
										<li>use the connect() function to "connect" React components to the Redux store</li>
										<li>write Actions and Action Creators to describe state changes</li>
										<li>write Reducers to respond to actions and update state</li>

										<h1>React<br />
										Friend Finder App</h1>
									</header>
									
									<p><b>Why we created this app/The problem our app solves</b>
								</br>People grow up and lose touch with old friends. This app helps them make new ones. Whether you’re living in a new town or just too busy to really meet people, this will help you make new connections. 

											Face time is still the key to sustain a friendship but people need to be connected first, naturally or by a little of effort, that's how our app is born.</p>
									
								<p><b>The team behind</b></br>
										We are Lambda students with diverse backgrounds in backend, frontend, UI and this app is our accomplishment through a build week. 
								</p>

								<p><b>App Features</b>
					
									</br>This is still work in progress. The app currently includes: 
									<li>a marketing page (done by UI member): <a href="https://nostalgic-mcclintock-4eeed5.netlify.com/">https://nostalgic-mcclintock-4eeed5.netlify.com/</a></li>
									<li>user onboarding process (done by me and other front-end guys): <a href="https://front-end-iy9y89tcy.now.sh/">https://front-end-iy9y89tcy.now.sh/</a></li>
							
									<i>We used React to create login, signup and create profile components, then use a Robot API to fetch profile picture data</i>
									</br>GitHub Repo: <a href="https://github.com/build-week-friend-finder/frontend">https://github.com/build-week-friend-finder/frontend</a></li>
									<li>user database: stored at backend <a href="https://bw-friendfinder.herokuapp.com/swagger-ui.html">https://bw-friendfinder.herokuapp.com/swagger-ui.html</a></li>

									</br>In the future release, we wish to build more functions:
									<li>Dashboard for app (where you “connect” or “move on” with someone)</li>
									<li>Connect with Facebook and input suggestions from there</li>
									<li>Geolocate other users in your area (i.e. at a concert, sports event, etc)</li>
									<li>Make it even more specific later (they have your same exact interests)</li>
									<li>Mention event to people with x-interest before it starts (i.e. Meetup or FB event)</li>

										<h1>React<br />
											Use My Tool App</h1>
									</header>
										
									<p><b>Why we created this app/The problem our app solves</b></p>
										<li>“I have a lot of tools and need a way to keep them organized”</li>
										<li>“I’m often loaning out tools to my neighbors/friends/family I need a way to keep track of who has my tools and how long they have had them.”</li>
										<li>“I have a lot of tools and I would like to make some extra money by renting those tools out.”</li>
										<li>“I need a way to find tools that I can borrow or rent from others in my area, 
												Makes clear the availability of tools for lending and tracks who borrowed them, and if they’ve been returned."</li>
												

									</br>
									<p><b>The team behind</b></br>
											We are Lambda students with diverse backgrounds in backend, frontend, UI, UX and this app is our accomplishment through a build week. 
									</p>
	
									<p><b>App Features</b>
						
										</br>The app currently includes: 
										<li>a marketing page (done by UI members including me): <a href="https://use-my-tool.now.sh/">https://use-my-tool.now.sh/</a>
										</br>GitHub Repo: <a href="https://github.com/lambda-usemytools/Honglandingpage">https://github.com/lambda-usemytools/Honglandingpage</a></li>
										<li>Sign Up, Sign In, Add a Tool, Borrow a Tool (done by front-end & back-end members): </br>      <a href="https://gracious-ptolemy-4a8ec7.netlify.com/">     https://gracious-ptolemy-4a8ec7.netlify.com/</a></li>
										<p>So our MVP: Users can log in and create a profile. They can then set up items they have available - anything from a shovel to power washers to tile saws. Users will be able to Create, Read, Update and Delete data. A 2nd user can log in and see items that users have available and request to borrow.
												<button onClick="window.location.href= 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyUDohkuE1g&feature=youtu.be'">App Demo</button>	
										</p>
										
	
										<b>In the future release, we wish to build more functions:</b>
										</br><p>Review system, map radius, friend system. 
												We would like to explore the idea of adding a community function to the app in the future.  A user could create a community DIY project (ex.  users could log in to network and build community.  Users could offer to loan tools or volunteer to work on that project.  This would create a community where individuals can come together to work on projects that will better their community.</br>
											
												
										</br>Additionally, we would like to add the feature of a user being able to upload projects that they are working on or have completed.  The user would be able to upload pictures of their projects and also a list of all the tools that they are using or have used for the project to create a kind of project recipe.
